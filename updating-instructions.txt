## Cheat Sheet for updating this extension and pushing the changes. (if I haven't done this in a while, I forget, though this might be useful for other extension developers too)

1. Make desired script changes in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Alfred/extensions/scripts/Reminders
2. Update update.xml and appcast.xml with new version number and summary of changes.
3. Copy all files to the git directory: cp * ~/github/brockangelo/Reminders
4. In Alfred --> Extensions, right click Reminders and select Export... Save the binary file to the Git directory
5. Commit and push changes.
